found this gem UE developer on YouTube, Mathew Wadstein, who introduces existing classes in BluePrint within 2 mins, mostly.
Went through most of them, relaxing and well paced.

He basically gave me the ideas what classes are the priorities to understand first. 
I would dive into docs.unreal-engine first, then watch his 2-min video, if l am still confused.
